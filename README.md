### ðŸ“» The Radios

The Baofeng UV-5R is a cheap, Chinese-made VHF/UHF Ham radio designed for basic use. It operates on VHF (136-174 Mhz) and UHF (400-520 MHz) bands. I`m using the stronger 8W version, however 5W versions are also available.

The Anytone 878UV II is a more-expensive, Chinese-made VHF/UHF/DMR Ham radio designed for professional use. It operates on VHF (136-174 MHz), UHF (400-480 MHz) and also supports DMR (Digital Mobile Radio).

### ðŸ’» CHIRP (Radio Programming)
I use CHIRP to program and configure the radios. You can manually create/edit channels in the field, but you are limited to numbers only.
With the use of CHIRP you can batch program multiple channels with alphanumeric characters, this makes it a LOT easier.
Download CHIRP from [here](https://chirpmyradio.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Download).

You also have the ability to pull frequencies such as local repeaters from various websites, all without leaving the program. This simplifies the programming process as everything is done automatically.
